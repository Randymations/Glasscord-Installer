# Glasscord Installer
A Windows installer for ~~[Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord/)~~

Note: Glasscord has been discontinued and all official resources have been deleted. At the moment of writing, Glasscord is still functional (Discord stable 131246), but if installation/execution is unsuccessful, Glasscord may have finally died. If this is the case, [Glasstron](https://github.com/NyaomiDEV/Glasstron) is the closest alternative.

[NyaomiDEV](https://github.com/NyaomiDEV/) is the creator of Glasscord and no changes were made to their work.

## Functions
- At the moment, this installer is **exclusively** for Windows
- ~~Functionality of this installer follows [Case 2, Method A](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord/wiki/Installation#case-2-you-already-have-an-app-folder) of [the official guide](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord/wiki/Installation/)~~
- There is **no** functionality for creating an "app" folder
- Option to uninstall

## Use
The exe can be downloaded and run as-is. Optionally, if you'd prefer to compile it yourself, the Python module [Pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) was used with the command `pyinstaller -F -i "icon/file/path" "Glasscord Installer.py"`. An icon file can be found [here](https://github.com/Randymations/Glasscord-Installer/blob/main/icon/Glasscord.ico) and a general tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOIJIk_maO4).

## Notes
- ~~After v1.0 of Glasscord officially releases, there will be an update to the installer.~~
- ~~If Glasscord is *ever* updated, the installer will be updated as well.~~
- The offical Glasscord Github page was deleted and all Electron compositing efforts are now being put towards [Glasstron](https://github.com/NyaomiDEV/Glasstron). 
- This was never meant to be a complicated project. It was created to work in conjunction with [Better Discord](https://betterdiscord.net/) as a tool to help friends install Glasscord who were too lazy to read the manual installation instructions.
