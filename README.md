# Glasscord-Installer
A Windows installer for [Glasscord](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord/)

[AryToNeX](https://github.com/AryToNeX/) is the creator of Glasscord and no changes were made to their work.

## Functions
- At the moment, this installer is **exclusively** for Windows
- Functionality of this installer follows <ins>Case 2</ins> of [the official guide](https://github.com/AryToNeX/Glasscord/wiki/Installation/)
- There is **no** functionality for creating an "app" folder

## Use
The exe can be downloaded and run as-is. Optionally, if you'd prefer to compile it yourself, the Python module [Pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) was used with the command `pyinstaller -F -i [icon file path] "Glasscord Installer.py"`. An icon file can be found [here](x) and a general tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOIJIk_maO4).

## Notes
- After v1.0 of Glasscord officially releases, there will be an update to the installer.
